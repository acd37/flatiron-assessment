# Flatiron School Assessment

## Task

You are working on a project for Flatiron School that will allow students to access, manage, and contribute to a collection of blogs written by current Flatiron School students and alumni. This site is written in JavaScript and React using React Router for client-side routing and JSON Server for a simple API.

Your task is to add a search feature that will allow the following:

User can access a search field to search for a blog by title
List of blogs should filter based on User input, showing only the blogs whose titles include the input characters
When search field is empty, page should display the full list of blogs
You are allowed to make any changes to the code that you feel are necessary. This includes adding new code as well as removing existing code.

Styling is not necessary but is encouraged.
